## Concept

Granny wants to start selling artisan Italian foods. She needs you to put up a simple menu web page for her. She's not actually your grandmother, she's just the tech-savvy old lady who lives next door. She's not really Italian either, but she knows a good profit margin when she sees one.

What's important is that she expects the items on her menu to change often, but she has a consistent pricing scheme.

To start, she wants a list of the cheeses on the menu, and their prices per pound. When she starts selling pastas, she wants a similar list of those. Some pastas are stuffed with cheese, Ravioli for example, and she expects the price of stuffed pastas to be based on the price of the cheese they're being stuffed with. One week she might sell Ravioli stuffed with Ricotta. The next week she might stuff it with Mozzarella.

Your job is to provide Granny with a bug-free way to update her menu when she needs to, without worrying about adjusting prices.
